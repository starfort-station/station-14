    maxCharge: 600 #lights drain 3/s but recharge of 2 makes this 1/s. Therefore 600 is 10 minutes of light.
    startingCharge: 600
  - type: BatterySelfRecharger
    autoRecharge: true
    autoRechargeRate: 2 #recharge of 2 makes total drain 1w / s so max charge is 1:1 with time. Time to fully charge should be 5 minutes. Having recharge gives light an extended flicker period which gives you some warning to return to light area.
